# Linux processes 

************************************
## How do we view our processes?

* To view processes use the 'ps' command 

```python
ps
```

* You can also use the 'top' command which will show the top processes in a real time view

```python
yop
```

* The 'jobs' command can also be sued for viewing background processes 

```python
jobs
```

# ps aux command

* This command will display all the information a user needs to current state of their systems running processes

```python
ps aux
```
